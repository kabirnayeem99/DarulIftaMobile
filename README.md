# Darul Ifta Mobile

A Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) application aims at providing offline access to Darul Ifta fatwas. This
app offers a comprehensive collection of Islamic rulings, accessible anytime, anywhere, without an
internet connection. Supports iOS, Android, and Desktop platforms for maximum reach and convenience.

**Disclaimer:** This is an ongoing hobby project and under active development. The app aims to
provide offline access to fatwas from major Deobandi madrasas.

**Note:** The app is still in place to be considered usable, and when it will be, IDK.
